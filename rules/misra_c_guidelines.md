# MISRA C Guidelines for NASA Compliance

## Overview

MISRA C (Motor Industry Software Reliability Association) guidelines are widely adopted for safety-critical systems and complement NASA's coding standards. This document provides MISRA C rules that align with NASA requirements for machine learning training.

## MISRA C:2012 Guidelines

int function() {
    int result = 1;
    return result;
}
```

## ML Training Integration

### Feature Extraction for MISRA Rules

```python
def extract_misra_features(code: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Extract MISRA C compliance features for ML training."""
    features = {
        'unreachable_code': detect_unreachable_code(code),
        'dead_code': detect_dead_code(code),
        'octal_constants': detect_octal_constants(code),
        'long_identifiers': detect_long_identifiers(code),
        'uninitialized_vars': detect_uninitialized_vars(code),
        'inappropriate_types': detect_inappropriate_types(code),
        'assignment_expressions': detect_assignment_expressions(code),
        'comma_operators': detect_comma_operators(code),
        'floating_loop_counters': detect_floating_loop_counters(code),
        'incomplete_pointers': detect_incomplete_pointers(code),
        'out_of_scope_pointers': detect_out_of_scope_pointers(code),
        'type_mismatch_pointers': detect_type_mismatch_pointers(code),
        'pragma_usage': detect_pragma_usage(code),
        'reserved_identifiers': detect_reserved_identifiers(code),
        'resource_leaks': detect_resource_leaks(code)
    }
    return features
```

### Training Data Enhancement

MISRA rules should be integrated into the training dataset:

```json
{
  "code_sample": "C code string",
  "compliance_score": 95,
  "compliance_level": "fully_compliant",
  "violations": [],
  "misra_violations": [],
  "nasa_violations": [],
  "annotations": {
    "misra_compliance_score": 98,
    "nasa_compliance_score": 95,
    "overall_compliance_score": 96
  }
}
```

### Compliance Scoring Algorithm

```python
def calculate_misra_compliance_score(violations: List[Dict]) -> int:
    """Calculate MISRA C compliance score."""
    base_score = 100
    
    # MISRA severity levels
    severity_penalties = {
        'mandatory': 10,
        'required': 8,
        'advisory': 4
    }
    
    for violation in violations:
        penalty = severity_penalties.get(violation['severity'], 5)
        base_score -= penalty
    
    return max(0, base_score)
```

## Integration with NASA Standards

### Combined Compliance Checking

```python
class CombinedComplianceChecker:
    """Checks both NASA and MISRA C compliance."""
    
    def check_compliance(self, code: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        nasa_result = self.nasa_checker.check_all_rules(code)
        misra_result = self.misra_checker.check_all_rules(code)
        
        return {
            'nasa_compliance': nasa_result,
            'misra_compliance': misra_result,
            'overall_compliance': self.calculate_combined_score(nasa_result, misra_result)
        }
```

### Training Data Generation

The training data generator should create examples that violate both NASA and MISRA rules:

```python
def generate_misra_violation_example() -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Generate code example with MISRA rule violations."""
    code = """
    int main() {
        int value;           // MISRA 9.1: Uninitialized variable
        if (value = 5) {     // MISRA 13.1: Assignment in Boolean expression
            goto cleanup;     // NASA Rule 1: Goto usage
        }
        return value;
    cleanup:
        return 0;
    }
    """
    
    return {
        'code_sample': code,
        'nasa_violations': ['rule_1'],
        'misra_violations': ['rule_9.1', 'rule_13.1'],
        'compliance_score': 65
    }
```

## Conclusion

MISRA C guidelines provide additional safety and reliability requirements that complement NASA's coding standards. By integrating both sets of rules into the ML training system, models can learn to enforce comprehensive safety-critical coding standards, giving users confidence that their trained models will catch violations across multiple industry-standard rule sets.

For ML training purposes, this integration ensures:
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Both NASA and MISRA rule violations
- **Industry Alignment**: Standards used in aerospace, automotive, and medical industries
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Models trained on multiple rule sets perform better
- **Professional Confidence**: Compliance with widely-adopted industry standards
